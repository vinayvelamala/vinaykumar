Mini Project:  E-Commerce Database Design and Documentation
Project Title: E-Commerce Database System

Objective: To design a scalable e-commerce database system that includes:
Transactional Database - For storing real-time operations data.
Data Warehouse - For analytical reporting and decision-making.
Data Mart - Focused subset of the warehouse for department-specific analytics.
The design will include tables, relationships, and columns aligned with Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) types.


Functional Requirements

Transactional Database Requirements:
Store information on users, products, orders, payments, inventory, shipping, and reviews.
Capture real-time transactional data for processing e-commerce activities.
Ensure 2NF for transactional consistency.


Data Warehouse Requirements:
Aggregate transactional data for historical analysis.
Support Slowly Changing Dimensions (Type 1 and Type 2).
Optimize for read-heavy analytics queries.

Transactional  Requirements:
------------------------------
Provide department-specific insights such as Sales, Inventory, and Customer Behavior.

Users	        -Stores customer details.
Products	-Stores product catalog details.
Orders	        -Tracks customer orders.
OrderDetails	-Line items in customer orders.
Payments	-Payment transactions for orders.
Inventory	-Current stock details.
Shipments	-Shipment and delivery tracking.
Reviews	        -Customer reviews for products.
coupons         -coupons need to create based on fixed or percentage 

Data Warehouse:
----------------
DWH_Users	Stores customer dimensions.	UserStatus (SCD Type 2)
DWH_Products	Stores product dimensions.	Price, Category (SCD Type 2)
DWH_Time	Tracks time dimensions for analytics.	N/A
DWH_Orders	Stores order transactions.	N/A
DWH_Payments	Stores payment transactions.	N/A
DWH_Inventory	Tracks inventory movements.	N/A
DWH_Warehouse   captures inventory movements, stock levels,transactions.DWH_Warehouse_details.               





Column Name	Description
----------      -----------
WarehouseKey	Primary key, uniquely identifies a record.
TimeKey	Foreign key referencing timestamp.
ProductKey	Foreign key referencing DimProducts.
WarehouseID	Identifier for the warehouse.
LocationKey	Foreign key referencing DimLocation.
StockIn	Quantity of stock received into the warehouse.
StockOut	Quantity of stock dispatched from the warehouse.
StockReturn	Quantity of stock returned.
StockDamaged	Quantity of stock damaged or lost.
CurrentStock	Current stock level for the product.

Data Mart:
---------
DM_Sales: Aggregated sales data for reporting.(daily sales - id,qty,revenue, discount, net revenue)
DM_Warehouse: Aggregated  stock report(WarehouseKey,TimeKey,ProductKey,WarehouseID,StockIn,StockOut,CurrentStock)


Documentation Deliverables: 
ER Diagram for Transactional Database.
Detailed SCD Implementation Guidelines.
SQL Scripts for table creation.
