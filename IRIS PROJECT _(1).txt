INTRODUCTION:
             The iris  project is a popular dataset commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. It involues  the classification of iris flowers into different species based on their
sepal length, speal width, petal length, petal width. This  dataset is  often used as a beginners examples for understanding and implementing various machine learning algorithms. It's
great  starting point to explore classification techniques and gain hands on experience in the field of  machine learning.

        3. Data Preprocessing:
                          Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the data if necessary.

        4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
                          Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset, visualize the distribution of features, and identify any patterns or correlations.

        5. Model Selection:
                          Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines.

        6. Model Training:
                         Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

        7. Model Evaluation and Selection: 
                         Compare the performance of different models and select the one with the highest accuracy or other desired evaluation metrics.

        8. Model Deployment: 
                         Once you have a trained and selected model, you can deploy it to make predictions on new, unseen iris flower samples.
