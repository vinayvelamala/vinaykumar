    "### 3. Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.1 What can Python do?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python can be used on a server to create web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2 Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.3 Who all are using python?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Google\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> Youtube\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> Dropbox\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> reddit\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -> NASA\n",

    "##### 3.5 Language Features\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "        => There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Directly run the program from the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "        => No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Platform Independent\n",
    "\n",
    "        => Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        => Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.\n",

    "### 4. Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.1 Speed Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> We have seen that Python code is executed line by line. But since Python is interpreted, it often results in slow execution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Note*: This, however, isn’t a problem unless speed is a focal point for the project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### 4.2 Weak in Mobile Computing and Browsers\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> While it serves as an excellent server-side language, Python is much rarely seen on the client-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Besides that, it is rarely ever used to implement smartphone-based applications. One such application is called Carbonnelle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### 4.3 Design Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> As you know, Python is dynamically-typed. This means that you don’t need to declare the type of variable while writing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> It uses duck-typing. But wait, what’s that? Well, it just means that if it looks like a duck, it must be a duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> While this is easy on the programmers during coding, it can raise run-time errors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### 4.4 Underdeveloped Database Access Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Compared to more widely used technologies like JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) and ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity), Python’s database access layers are a bit underdeveloped.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> Consequently, it is less often applied in huge enterprises.\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### 4.5 Simple\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> No, we’re not kidding. Python’s simplicity can indeed be a problem. Take my example. I don’t do Java, I’m more of a Python person.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> To me, its syntax is so simple that the verbosity of Java code seems unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -> This was all about the Advantages and Disadvantages of Python Programming Language."
