tell me about Dataflow & apache Beam:-

1. data processing tool for both Batch & NRT data
2. dataflow is fully managed, Cluster less and cost effective
3. Dataflow is auto scalling(vertical & Horizental), servers/worker nodes will spin/provision at the time job execution
4. Dataflow is GCP componenet on top of apache beam.
5. dataflow developed on top of Apache Beam, which is open source it's like Spark tool
6.  Data Sourcing
    Beam reads your data from a diverse set of supported sources, no matter if itâ€™s on-prem or in the cloud.
  
   Data Processing
   Beam executes your business logic for both batch and streaming use cases.

   Data Writing
   Beam writes the results of your data processing logic to the most popular data sinks in the industry.

7. Beam supports write once run anywhere (Spark, dataflow, Flink, Beam, Samza....)
8. Create Multi-language Pipelines (Java, python, SQL,Go ....)
9. Beam executes large datasets in multile nodes(scalling) to complete less time
10. Dataflow has 100+ predefined data pipeline template avaialble
